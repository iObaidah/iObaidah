- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iObaidah
- I'm a Tech and Design Engineer, though I'm not certified as I postponed my studies--Just *self-taught*. I'm sure you will be asking, "Then why tf did you write that you're an Engineer?", 
and my answer lies in the interests section. 
- ðŸ‘€ I'm so deeply IN LOVE and SOOO INTERESTED in web-development, programming and coding, engineering and finding solutions, building new ways to live, object-oriented applications, and IOT (Internet of Things); my list isn't ending!

"Why are you so all-around-the-place?" 
- You will be shocked, but I'm not. I've had my interest in learning since a very young age, and rather than going after video games and wasting my time around lots of people, like a lot of human beings do, I would sit on my PC and look after growing my mindset, skills, and learning new things. I was so curious, still, that I've even looked for "what should I do to beat Einstein?" or "What can I do as a 10-year-old to become a billionaire," and the endless questions that come only when you're a young, curious child.

"What is a Tech & Design Engineer?"
- A simple Designer and Content Creator, Programmer, Developer, and Engineer.

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @iObaidah
- I'm a Tech and Design Engineer, though I'm not certified as I postponed my studies. I'm sure you will be asking "then why tf are did you write that you're an Engineer", 
and my answer lies in the intrests section. 
- ðŸ‘€ I'm so deeply IN LOVE and SOOO INTERESTED in web-development, programming and coding, engineering and finding solutions, building new ways to live, object oriented applications, and IOT (Internet of Things) and my list isn't ending!

"Why are you so all-around-the-place?" 
- You will be shocked, but I'm simply not. I've got my interests in learning since a very young age, and rather than going after video games and wasting my time around lots of people, like I lot of human beings do, I would sit on my PC and look after growing my mindset, skills, and learning new things. I was so curious, still, that I've even looked for "what should I do to beat Einstein?" or "What can I do as a 10-year to become a billionaire" and the endless questions that comes only when you're a young-year-curious.

"What is Tech & Design Engineer mean?"
- A simple Designer and Content Creator, Programmer, Developer and Engineer.
